# GNNs_EEG_Spike_Detection

This repository contains the implementation of the six machine learning (ML) models described in our study submitted to Artificial Intelligence in Medicine under the title "Graph Neural Networks in EEG Spike Detection". We compare the two proposed models (FC-GNN and CA-GIN) with four other architectures in the literature.
