# GNNs_EEG_Spike_Detection

This repository contains the implementation of the five machine learning (ML) models described in our study submitted to Clinical Neurophysiology under the title "Graph Neural Networks in EEG Spike Detection". We compare the two proposed models (FC-GIN and attention-GIN) with three other architectures in the literature. The proposed models achieve a higher average precision (AP) on our EEG spike detection task.
